# Dotfiles configurations

This project is strictly inclined towards i3users and is designed to preserve their custom settings that can be installed on a fresh Ubuntu installation. It's prime purpose is for disaster recovery and it is meant for fresh installs only (for now).

The repository contains the dotfiles of:
* zshrc
* vimrc

Config files of: 
* i3
* i3blocks  

It also contains:
* System and terminal fonts
* vim plugins and themes

The settings are kept in a user basis catagoriazation. The repository consists of a install script that shall be used to auto configure the i3wm as shown in the images below. Also, there is a seperate **README** within each user directory to help you understand their folder structure and setup. It is essential to understand the **README** as this will help you setup the system exactly the way it was ment by the user.

## Things to do after running the install script  
The install script will make the mentioned changes, but for the changes to settle in properly, a reboot is recommended (A relogin should work too).  
You are free to change the settings as per you liking once the installation has finished, **but we won't be responsible for any damage of data or hardware after that**.

## dotfile list
The user list is as follows:
### 1. disconsis

### 2. humble_D
"Easy on the eyes, easy on the battery"  
This setting is for a web application developer / coder. My settings comes with a README that has a list of softwares that you can be install to boost your productivity if you are also into the same bussiness. Occational use of mouse is part of this setting. It uses a **DuoDark** color scheme to give more of *hacker's* touch to the UI. The scripts have been set to minimize battery usage and is perfect for an ultrabook on the move.
